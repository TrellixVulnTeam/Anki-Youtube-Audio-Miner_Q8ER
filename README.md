# Anki-Youtube-Audio-Miner
<p>This is basically how I&apos;ve been studying Japanese for the last couple of months now, so finally I&apos;m sharing this pretty nifty tool that actually helped reigniting my passion for learning the language.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&apos;s a cool way to combine all of these 3 packages into one thing: watching youtube, word mining and shadowing practices. Of course subs2srs already succeed at doing so and there are other addons like Youtube Subs2srs (that I kinda stole the code design from) that did similar stuff. But because yomichan was so effective at getting words and all of it&apos;s meaning from the web, so I&apos;ve been exclusively using that to mine words from Youtube, although it didn&apos;t actually take the audio from the youtube video, which left me kinda clueless when I&apos;m trying to mimic the natives&apos; accent and manners of speaking and what not. And thus, this addon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I usually use this in tandem with yomichan. First getting the words and it&apos;s original sentences by yomichan-ing, then use the add-on to add the youtube stuff into the selected cards. The add-on would check whether the phrase field matches any of the lines in the video&apos;s transcript, if so then the audio field would be updated to the mp3 file that the matched line takes place. Sounds complicated, and yeah it is kind of complicated, but fun to use when you get the hang of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course you can use it with other languages as well, and it will basically add audio to anything that exists within the video. Words? Check. Phrases? Check. For example, you want audio for a made-up word: &quot;Bupperisticat&quot;, you would get one as long as the chosen video has the word inside it&apos;s transcript.</p>

<p>1. Go into the card browser&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Select the cards that you want to add the audio&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Go to Edit -&gt; Mine audio... (or use the short-cut key Ctrl Alt M)&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Paste the youtube link into the box, select the language of your choosing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Choose the phrase field that you want to match, and the audio field that you want add/replace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Press &quot;Download&quot; to download the audio and it&apos;s subtitles. Then the &quot;Extract sound bites&quot; button to get the sound bites, you can also select the range of audio you want to use. Then &quot;Add audio&quot; to the selected cards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you&apos;ve already downloaded the video, skip to the extract sound bites step (choose the SC.[your language].srt file and the SC.mp3 file inside the downloads folder if it prompts you to). If you&apos;ve already extracted the bites, just push the &quot;Add audio&quot; button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will add an instruction video if people are interested in the future.</p>
